# Datastructures

This repo contains all the codes for my course: CS-1203 at Ashoka University during Monsoon 2022.

I have included in class codes as well as deliverables that we have had for the course.

I've created different folders for the types of data structures wherever possible, and have included both homeworks as well as their respective class codes in those.

So here's my list of coding attempts for this course :)

1. Stress-test for loops - in the main branch
2. Pointers and Arrays - in the main branch
3. Implement Linked List - in the Linked List branch
4. Half a Linked List - in the Linked List branch
5. Reverse a Linked List - in the Linked List branch
6. Chunk Reverse a Linked List - in the Linked List branch
7. Binary Tree - in the Binary Tree branch
8. Binary Tree Delete Operation - in the Binary Tree branch
9. Selection Sort I  - in the Array and Linked List branch respectively
10. Insertion Sort I - in the Array and Linked List branch respectively
12. Quick Sort II - in the Array and Linked List branch respectively
13. Heaps and Heapsort - in the Binary Trees branch
14. AVL Trees - in the main branch
15. Skip Lists - in the main branch
